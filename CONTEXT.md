# CONTEXT - Data Analysis Utility: Incident Report Processor

## Company: Brasaland

## Your company

**Brasaland** is a grilled-food restaurant chain with 14 locations across Colombia and Florida (US). You are part of the internal **Brasaland Digital** team, working under **Nicolas Park (CTO)** and in close coordination with **Felipe Guerrero (Operations Director)**.

Operations tracks every operational incident in the chain: equipment failures, supply issues, customer complaints, food-quality incidents, and staff-related situations. Until now, each store manager logged incidents in a shared spreadsheet. That sheet was exported to CSV, and your test file includes **100 rows** representing one month of history across all 14 locations.

Your script's goal is to validate and summarize this data before it is used as the basis for the real-time operations dashboard that will fully replace the spreadsheet.

## Stakeholder note

> **From Nicolas Park (CTO):**
> "Felipe's team will use this every day. Keep console output clean and fast; they run it in terminal before the morning meeting. CSV export is for Ashley: she needs to paste results into a spreadsheet. Make sure the structure is meaningful: one row per metric, with columns `metric`, `value`, and optional `percentage`."
